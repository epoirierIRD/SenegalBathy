Plot Senegal bathymetry form GEBCO with your morrings locations

This code was prepared for a report to show mooring locations in the vicinity of Joal Fadiouth and Rufisque with bathymetry in the background, geographic coordinates, grid and mainland coastline. It is published to help my friends from Senegal (Amoul Solo, Nio Far) and anybody interested. Of course it was based on free code available on the wed that is cited in the first lines.

This is the figure you can get. You can adjust your locations. But if you end up outside Senegal coast, you will have first to get a new bathymetry file from GEBCO website.

The source file for bathymetry extracted form GEBCO is provided here: gebco_2023_n16.4839_s10.5513_w-20.0759_e-14.4289.nc

Hope it helps!
